Now using Let's Encrypt for simple and free SSL certs!

#### Prerequisites

* [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (just for development)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
* [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* Make

#### Running Locally

Running locally will use a self-signed SSL certificate for `localhost` only. 

```shell
$ make run-local
```

Try it! (you can ignore the safety warning since it's a self-signed cert)

```shell
https://localhost
```

#### Environment Variables

* `VAULT_PREFIX`: Key prefix for Vault secrets
* `VAULT_TOKEN`: Vault token
* `VAULT_ADDR`: Vault address
* `DOMAIN`: TLS domain for HTTPS server

#### Running with Let's Encrypt


1. Clone this repo
2. Ensure you have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed on server
3. run `DOMAIN=secret.example.com make run`
4. Let's Encrypt may take a few minutes to validate your domain
5. open `https://secret.example.com`


### Security notice!

You should always run this behind SSL/TLS; otherwise, a message will be sent unencrypted!
